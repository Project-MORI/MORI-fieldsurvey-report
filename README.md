# MORI Field Survey Report

A structured, map-linked archive of field surveys conducted under Project MORI.

This repository contains the source files for the MORI Field Survey Report, a documentation website built with MkDocs.
The purpose of this site is to centralize, standardize, and visualize all field-survey results across regions and years, enabling quick access to:
	•	Survey locations and core metadata
	•	Per-survey notes, observations, and media
	•	Survey routes and participating team members
	•	Detailed pages for each survey ID
	•	Maps (GeoJSON-based) that link directly to survey pages
	•	Integration with remote-sensing analyses such as JJ-FAST, DETER, NASA FIRMS, and PRODES

The website is published via GitHub Pages and serves as an organized reference for all field-based ground truth used in Project MORI.
